3) **Recipe for trilece is :  mix a sponge cake base with a blend of three milksâ€”evaporated milk, condensed milk, and heavy creamâ€”soak thoroughly, then top with a caramel sauce for a delicious trilece dessert.** :
   
Trilece is a popular Albanian dessert that features a soft sponge cake soaked in a mixture of three types of milk and topped with caramel sauce. While the recipe you provided seems close to the traditional trilece concept, it could benefit from a few adjustments to make it more authentic and flavorful:

1. Sponge Cake Base:
- Use a light and airy sponge cake as the base. Ensure it's not too sweet as the sweetness will come from the three milks and caramel sauce.

2. Milk Mixture:
- The traditional trilece uses a mixture of equal parts evaporated milk, condensed milk, and heavy cream. Mix these together and soak the sponge cake with this rich, milky blend.

3. Soaking:
- Make sure to soak the sponge cake generously with the three-milk mixture. The cake should be thoroughly soaked to achieve a moist and decadent texture.

4. Caramel Sauce:
- Prepare a rich caramel sauce to pour over the top of the trilece. The caramel adds a wonderful contrast to the milky cake and enhances the overall flavor profile.

By adjusting these elements, you can create a more authentic and delicious trilece dessert. Feel free to follow this guidance and enjoy your homemade Albanian dessert!
